          <p>
            <b>
              After you are done writing, you must edit the blogger's editor
              once before finishing your post. Like 'adding a space and remove
              it' or 'change from compose view to html view'.
            </b>
            Because the content is not going to be saved as a draft or updated
            or published until the blogger editor updates the post data that is
            hidden.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is difficult to find where the blogger editor store our post
            data. So until we find a way, this will be the way. Just give a
            small change to the blogger editor after you are done writing.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>
              Pressing 'Ctrl' and 'q' will copy what is in the blogger
              editor(Left side) and paste to the markdown editor(Right side).
              Use this short cut('ctrl + q') for adding images.
            </b>
            But you can also use the markdown editor's image uploading system.
            In that case the image will be stored as a data in your post. And
            your post can be a bit messy. For the videos, you have to use the
            blogger editor to add them. Markdown editor does not support videos
            and it will probably convert the video to a single image.
          </p>

            If you have a custom theme, it might cause some problems for some
            cases. Because they affect styling of the edit page.
          </p>
          <p>
            In many other case, if this extension is not working, just try to
            refresh(F5) the edit page.
